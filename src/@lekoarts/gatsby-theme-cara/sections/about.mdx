## About Me

Pleased to meet you! I am a perpetual tinkerer, solver-of-problems, and fixer-of-things.
I am passionate about creating and delivering high-quality, accessible software.
After years as Registered Nurse, I found myself drawn to technology and its transformative capability to
impact lives on a massive scale. Let's explore how we can work together!
