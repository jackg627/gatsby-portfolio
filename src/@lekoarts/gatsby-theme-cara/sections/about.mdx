## About Me

I am a perpetual tinkerer, solver of problems, and fixer of things.
After years as Registered Nurse, I found myself drawn to technology and its transformative capability to
impact lives at scale.
I am passionate about creating and delivering high-quality, accessible software.
 Let's explore how we can work together!
