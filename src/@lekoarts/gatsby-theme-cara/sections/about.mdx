## About Me




After years as Registered Nurse, I found myself drawn to technology and its transformative capability to
impact lives at scale. I am passionate about bringing life to new ideas and making them accessible
to a diverse audience. My engineering philosophy centers around a holistic approach, taking all
appropriate time to deeply explore and understand the client's underlying needs and desires in order to
architect exceptional solutions.


As a developer, I am an avid solver of problems and relentless student. I am always looking for
new ways to expand my skillset and abilities, both within the software world and without. When I'm not
programming, you can usually find me exploring Colorado with my dog and friends, gardening, or tinkering
with one of my many hobbies (my 'too-many hobbies', as my partner might say ðŸ˜†)
My greatest achievements in life have come from stepping outside of my comfort zone, so I am
always open to trying new things and seeking new inspirations.
