## About Me

Pleased to meet you! I am a passionate software engineer with a love of learning and progress.
Previously a pediatric Registered Nurse, I found myself drawn to technology and its transformative capability to
impact lives on a massive scale. My engineering (and life) philosophy centers around authenticity and trust.
My commitment to deeply understanding clients' needs, exceptional communication abilities, and unwavering dedication to
to delivering high-quality solutions make me an ideal candidate for your organization. I also love to have fun! In my free time,
you'll likely find me hiking outdoors, meeting new people at a local brewery, or far down a STEM-related rabbit hole.
Contact me and let's make our world better together!
